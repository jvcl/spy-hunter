PROJECT NAME: SPYHUNTER

VERSION: 1.0

DEVELOPER: JORGE ANDRES VALDIVIA-QUEZADA

PURPOSE: 

SpyHunter is an interactive game that simulates a car driving in a freeway of 13 lanes. 

The user has the control of a white car moving through these lanes. The white car has to dodge 

incoming cars and avoid collisions. The game is over every time the user’s car collides with other 

car or an obstacle.

The user interacts with the game through the mouse and the keyboard. With the 

mouse the person playing the game can move the car to right or left to dodge incoming cars. 

The keyboard is used in the arcade mode so the user can accelerate, break and shoot bullets to 

incoming cars.
